JCSUnity version 1.6.7 Naming Manual (Status)


-- Naming Explaination --

* [Check Variables] - variable only for checking, do not adjust the value of 
 the variables, but you can use to check to see the effect during runtime.
 
* [Initialize Variables] - variable only work in initialize time, so set 
 the variable before hitting play button.
     
* [Runtime Variables] - variable will work on both initialize time and 
 runtime, you can adjust the variable during runtime and see the effect.
     
* [Helper Variables] - variable only happens in developer mode, so it won't 
 exist in the final build. Usually the helper tool in for level designer.
