JCSUnity is a component driven framework built to allow the user 
to quickly generate commonly used game mechanics and features 
such as UI functionality and player movement. This will allow 
for a faster initial development. Most components work individually 
while other components must be used in tandem with others. 
Individually components can be combined to create new behaviors.

## Features ##





### Network Module ###
I have never use Unity's network module, but I heard a lot of people
complain how bad Unity handle networking/socket programming. I provide
the basic client side TCP and UDP socket class and some switch 
port/host function, so you can use it with the server side code that 
you confortable with. <br/>
