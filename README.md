# JCSUnity #
JCSUnity is a component driven framework built to allow the user 
to quickly generate commonly used game mechanics and features 
such as UI functionality and player movement. This will allow 
for a faster initial development. Most components work individually 
while other components must be used in tandem with others. 
Individually components can be combined to create new behaviors.


## Important Notice ##
All media assets inside JCSUnity do not fall under its license. 
These assets are placeholders only, and should only be used for 
testing purposes. They are NOT, under any circumstances, to be 
used commercially. By using this framework you agree to these 
terms, and understand that you are solely responsible for any 
legal action taken against you for using, or attempting to use 
any placeholder assets commercially.


## How to use it? ##
JCSUnity is like other Unity plugins. You can download the latest 
release from the above tab, or from the link 
[here](https://github.com/jcs090218/JCSUnity/releases/latest)
. Simply create a new project in Unity then import all of 
the assets into that project. Then you can start all of the tools 
in the JCSUnity framework. <br/>
